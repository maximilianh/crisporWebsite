                <p><strong>RNAstructure 6.3 (4/5/2021)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Added the m6A nearest neighbor parameters. These can be accessed using --alphabet m6A in most command line programs. Use M or 6 to represent m6A in sequences.</li>

                </ol>
                <p><strong>RNAstructure 6.2 (11/27/2019)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The OREGA program was added as a command line program. This is a genetic algorithm that evolves an input sequence to have a longer end-to-end distance.</li>
                  <li>The ETEcalculator program was added as a command line program to estimate the end-to-end distance of an input sequence.</li>
                  <li>The TurboHomology command line program was added. This program does homology modeling for RNA secondary structure. It adds a new sequence to an existing multiple sequence alignment and estimates the secondary structure of the new sequence.</li>
                  <li>ThreshKnot was added as an option to ProbKnot. </li>
                  <li>The partition function was updated to work in the log(partition function) space. Previously, a scaling factor was used to prevent overflows or underflows. The log space is more robust to restraints and constraints.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a problem with the JAVA GUI that prevented it from running on some Linux machines.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in Fold where it could miss the lowest free energy structure on rare occassions (for a window size set too large).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>RNAstructure 6.1 (10/08/2018)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The <a href="../Text/efn2.html">efn2</a> program now outputs folding free energy error estimates.</li>
                  <li>Added capability to fold (and bifold) to predict structures with folding free energy change &gt; 0 kcal/mol. If the lowest free energy structure with pairs has folding free energy change &gt; 0 kcal/mol, the predicted lowest free energy structure will be a structure without pairs (with free energy change of 0 kcal/mol). Suboptimal structures can have pairs and folding free energy change &gt; 0 kcal/mol.</li>
                  <li>Updated the DNA enthalpy change parameters for tri-loops and tetra-loops.  The new values are based on experimental data in the literature.  This fixes a bug that sometimes prevented DNA structure prediction at temperatures other than 37 degrees C.</li>
                  <li>Added the ability to read files from STDIN and write to STDOUT when passing "-" (hyphen) for the filename. This currently works for several programs including Fold and partition.</li>
                  <li>Updated interfaces for Fold, partition, ct2dot, and dot2ct to include the "--quiet" flag to suppress progress or other verbose output.</li>
                  <li><a href="../Text/TurboFold.html">TurboFold</a> can now accept multi-sequence FASTA files as input. The output CT file names are generated from the sequence names in the FASTA file.</li>
                  <li>In <a href="../GUI/html/StructureEditor.html">StructureEditor</a>, added ability to move number-labels on nucleobases by clicking and dragging with the mouse.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>RNAstructure 6.0.1 Minor Update (02/12/2018)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>When using --MFE in Fold, the energy of the minimum free energy structure is now shown in the output CT file.
                  </li>
                  <li>Improved RNAstructure repository infrastructure, including Makefile organization, regression testing, and GUI testing.</li>
                  <li>Updated the OligoWalk Text interface. The new version uses our standard command-line parser and both text and html formatted report output are available.</li>
                  <li>Improved the Python Interface. It now supports Python 3.x. The pre-compiled extension is now provided in the binary distributions of RNAstructure. It should also be easier to compile the interface on all supported operating systems. Also updated and improved Python documentation in the manual.</li>
                  <li>Added two new options to draw: The ability to specify a range of structures to draw (e.g. 3-7) and the ability to limit the total number of structures drawn.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in the Java GUI that prevented the Stochastic and OligoWalk tools from running when START was clicked.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a minor bug in the energy calculation of flush coaxial stacking in exerior loops (ergexterior). The bug caused very small energy differences in rare circumstances.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>RNAstructure 6.0 (09/21/2017)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>RNAstructure now can predict secondary structures for
                    sequences of any size alphabet. For example, an inosine
                    could be included along with RNA A, C, G, and U. To
                    accomodate this, a new data table format was implemented for
                    storing thermodynamic parameters. At this time, we have no
                    complete set of nearest neighbor rules for alphabets other
                    than standard DNA or standard RNA.</li>
                  <li><a title="TurboFold" href="../Text/TurboFold.html">TurboFold</a>                    is upgraded to TurboFold II, which now predicts
                    alignments in addition to conserved RNA structures for a set
                    of input RNA homologs. TurboFold also can use <a href="../Text/Rsample.html">Rsample</a> to
                    make use of SHAPE mapping data for one or more homologs.</li>
                  <li><a href="../Text/Rsample.html">Rsample</a> is added. This program takes a
                    sequence and SHAPE mapping data and outputs a partition
                    function save file, which can then be used to model the
                    structure of a sequence that populates multiple
                    conformations.</li>
                  <li><a title="CycleFold details" href="../Text/CycleFold.html">CycleFold</a>                    added. This program takes an RNA sequence predicts
                    both canonical and non-canonical base pairs or base pairing
                    probabilities.</li>
                  <li><a title="EDcalculator information page" href="../Text/EDcalculator.html">EDcalculator</a>                    added. This program takes a sequence and a desired
                    secondary structure and calculates the ensemble defect for
                    that sequence to fold to the specific structure.</li>
                  <li><a href="../GUI/html/StructureEditor.html">StructureEditor</a> added. This JAVA program
                    edits structure drawings and outputs publication-quality
                    drawings. This also can edit the underlying base pairing
                    structure and sequence.</li>
                  <li>The –x option was added to ShapeKnots for incorporating
                    experimentally-determined pairing bonuses.</li>
                  <li>Most RNAstructure programs that accept CT files as input
                    can now also accept <a href="../Text/File_Formats.html#DotBracket">Dot-Bracket</a>
                    (dbn) files. The type of structure input file is
                    auto-detected, so no additional action is necessary on the
                    user's part.</li>
                  <li><a href="../Text/RemovePseudoknots.html">RemovePseudoknots</a> now has a much faster
                    pseudoknot analysis method in the <strong>-m</strong>
                    (Maximize Basepairs) mode. </li>
                  <li><a href="../Text/efn2.html">efn2</a> can now calculate the energies of
                    pseudoknot-containing structures.</li>
                  <li>Added <strong>validate</strong> program which helps in
                    automated input file validate for multiple file types
                    including CT, DotBracket, SEQ, FASTA, etc.</li>
                  <li>Java GUI Enhancements:</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The native library is now compiled with SMP modules so
                      calculations are now performed in "parallel mode" (i.e.
                      using multiple threads). </li>
                    <li>Improved Sequence "Speak" sound files (• Removed clicks
                      and gaps at beginning and end of files • Increased tempo
                      for shorter sounds • Added alert sound for invalid
                      characters • softened beginning of "C" to sound less like
                      "T")</li>
                    <li>Added new menu "Structure Prediction" that combines
                      several structure analysis workflows for predicting single
                      structures, bimolecular structures, and structures common
                      to two or more sequences.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <li>Bugfixes:</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Fixed a bug in dynalign_ii that resulted in a segfault
                      immediately after the progress indicator reached&nbsp;100%
                      (i.e. during tracebacks).</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug where the coaxstack.dat (mismatch-mediated
                      coaxial stacking) table was assumed to be symmetric. This
                      can affect the energy output of efn2, Multilign,
                      oligoscreen, and OligoWalk.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug where setting window size &gt;0 in
                      AccessFold would lead to seg fault.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug in Fold where using the --DMS option was not
                      working as expected because the underlying gamma
                      distribution parameters for modeling the pseudo free
                      energy change were not being correctly stored and read. A
                      new test case was added to check for bugs going forward.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug where --DMS was an option for ShapeKnots,
                      but the DMS data was not being used.</li>
                    <li><strong>NAPSS</strong>, a program that uses NMR
                      experimental data to improve structure prediction, has
                      been updated to the version described in <a target="_blank"
                        title="Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Assisted Prediction of Secondary Structure for RNA: Incorporation of Direction-Dependent Chemical Shift Constraints"
                        href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00833">10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00833</a>.
                      (Previously an older version was distributed by mistake.)
                      The program has been updated further in conjunction with
                      other changes to the RNAstructure codebase.</li>
                    <li>RemovePseudoknots no longer modifies structure labels
                      (previously it rewrote the structure energies, but did so
                      incorrectly). Users can use the efn2 program to more
                      accurately calculate the energies of structures with and
                      without pseudoknots.</li>
                    <li>The –x option in Fold and partition now
                      works properly.</li>
                    <li>The correct gamma distribution files used for DMS data
                      have now been added. (Previously these should have been
                      present, but were missing).</li>

                    <li>Sequence Editor now allows copy/paste&nbsp;and does not
                      restrict keystrokes as before.<br>
                      Text is color-coded to show invalid bases (red) and
                      lower-case bases (blue) to help highlight potential
                      problems.</li>
                    <li>Users can now easily select&nbsp;Recent files
                      or&nbsp;Example files in prediction dialogs</li>
                    <li>It is easier to run and monitor multiple concurrent
                      calculations&nbsp;because the progress indicator is now
                      displayed inside each parameter dialog (instead of as a
                      separate window disjointed from the main application).</li>
                    <li>Some calculations (Fold, AllSub) can now be Canceled.</li>
                    <li>Improved "Draw &gt; Go to Structure.." dialog that
                      allows quick an easy scanning through available
                      structures.</li>
                    <li>Added new backbone rendering styles for structure
                      drawing: "Render Circular Structure" and "Render Flat
                      (Linear) Structure"</li>
                    <li>Improved About Window including&nbsp;function to extract
                      Example files (mostly useful for Mac App Bundle)</li>
                    <li>Help menu can directly launch either local or online
                      manual.</li>
                    <li>Java GUI now auto-detects the location of data_tables
                      and the native RNAstructure_GUI library, so setting these
                      on the command-line or environment are no longer
                      necessary. The jar can be executed directly. The GUI now
                      verifies the version of the native library to ensure
                      compatibility.</li>
                    <li>Fixed detection of operating system to be compatible
                      with newer OS and Java versions.</li>
                    <li>Deployment on Mac is now via DMG file for easier
                      installation.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug that causes zooming issues in the structure
                      drawing window.</li>
                  </ol>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>RNAstructure 5.8 (12/01/2015)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Added <a href="../Text/design.html">design</a> (to find a
                    sequence that will fold to a given structure).</li>
                  <li>Added <a href="../Text/ProbScan.html">ProbScan</a> (to
                    calculate loop and stack probabilities).</li>
                  <li>Added functionality to <a href="../Text/draw.html">draw</a>
                    to annotate loop probabilities.</li>
                  <li>Improved the end-to-end regression testing framework for
                    command-line&nbsp;interfaces.</li>
                  <li>Deprecated the native Windows GUI interface in favor of
                    the JAVA GUI on all platforms.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where efn2 was incorrectly calculating the
                    average asymmetry for some multibranch loops. Also, fixed a
                    bug that led to rounding errors. These changes can also
                    affect Multilign, OligoWalk, and ShapeKnots, which use efn2.</li>
                  <li>Improved the Java GUI behavior when the native
                    RNAstructure library is not found or cannot be loaded. Now
                    an error message is shown and the application exits
                    gracefully. Previously it would crash.</li>
                  <li>Improved the Java GUI behavior when the DATAPATH variable
                    is either not set or it points to an invalid location. Now
                    an informative message is shown at program startup.
                    Previously no message was shown until the user tried to
                    perform an action that required native access to the
                    DATAPATH, at which time a less informative message was
                    shown.</li>
                  <li>Fixed bugs in the Java GUI:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Printing structures and images did not work (only blank
                      pages were produced).</li>
                    <li>The GUI would crash on startup if the splash window (or
                      any other program window) was still open when the main
                      application window was created.</li>
                    <li>Typing a non-existant file name in the Open Sequence
                      window caused the program to freeze.</li>
                    <li>Selecting a file with an upper- or mixed-case extension
                      resulted in a "File Not Found" error.</li>
                    <li>The main menu became unresponsive when the toolbar was
                      moved to a floating window.</li>
                    <li> The Java GUI DotPlotDialog window&nbsp;crashed when
                      reading in postscript legend colors under some
                      circumstances (such as when the colors were specified as
                      doubles instead of ints (e.g. 10.0 instead of 10).</li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;<br>
                  <strong>RNAstructure 5.7 (12/4/2014)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Added <a href="../Text/dynalign.html">Dynalign II</a>.</li>
                  <li>Added <a href="../Text/accessfold.html">AccessFold</a>.</li>
                  <li>Added <a href="../Text/phmm.html">phmm</a>, a pairwise
                    Hidden Markov Model for RNA sequence alignment. This is in
                    the back ends to Dynalign, Dynalign II, PARTS, and
                    TurboFold. This is a new front end for sequence alignment.</li>
                  <li>Added new help page that provides <a href="../Text/pathways.html">pathways</a>
                    for using the command line interfaces.</li>
                  <li>Added a flag (--simple) to <a href="../Text/efn2.html">efn2</a>
                    so that the energies can be calculated for structures using
                    the same rules as the dynamic programming algorithms.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where specifying a constraint file (in any
                    program or OS) was removing prior unpairing constraints
                    specified in a sequence file.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in ShapeKnots. While filling in dangle or
                    double mismatches it created new non-canonical pairs, which
                    led to giving large positive energies to those structures.</li>
                  <li>Improved ShapeKnots speed by removing boundaries checking
                    in vectors.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in the Windows GUI for bimolecular folding
                    where internal loops were intermittently being forbidden.</li>
                  <li>Change the Macintosh compiler flags to match new Clang
                    compiler. Also, revised code to match the fact that OpenMP
                    is absent from Clang.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>RNAstructure 5.6 (7/31/2013)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Added Multifind to package (Linux and mac only).</li>
                  <li>Added parallel processing (SMP) versions of bifold,
                    bipartition, efn2, Fold, MaxExpect, oligoscreen, partition,
                    and stochastic. These programs take advantage of multicore
                    computing environments.</li>
                  <li>The Windows GUI now runs in parallel on multicore
                    computers for predicting lowest free energy structures,
                    calculating partition functions, calculating free energy
                    changes, oligoscreen calculations, and stochastic sampling.</li>
                  <li>Fixed bug where command line programs were not recognizing
                    long flags without associated parameters. This also affected
                    the web servers. </li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug with reading HMM alignment parameters for
                    Dynalign calculations in the Windows GUI. This was causing
                    the program to crash for Dynalign calculations.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where bootstraped restraints were not being
                    correctly calculated in Fold.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>RNAstrucure 5.5 Update (5/16/2013)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Uploaded a new version of the Windows 64-bit graphical
                    interface. This fixes problems with launching the program
                    from the start menu. </li>
                </ol>

                  <li>Code Base
                    <ol>
                      <li>Updated Makefiles to build more efficiently and
                        standardized their formats.</li>
                      <li>Simplified text interface parsing machinery and made
                        all flags case-insensitive.</li>
                      <li>Cleaned up format, comments, and organization in all
                        text interfaces that use the standard parsing machinery.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li> Data tables/thermodynamics/parameters
                    <ol>
                      <li>Updated dnacoaxstack.dat. Fixed problem where a subset
                        of mismatch-mediated coaxial stacks were missed in DNA.</li>
                      <li>Fixed bug where not all special DNA tetraloops were

                  </li>
                  <li> Drawing Framework
                    <ol>
                      <li>Reduced the size of dot plot labels so they didn't run
                        together in certain instances.</li>
                      <li>Made a small change to dot plot layout so dots at the
                        first nucleotide index always fall on the first grid
                        line.</li>
                      <li>Fixed a bug where sometimes plot bounds weren't set
                        right, so some dots weren't shown.</li>
                      <li>Fixed a bug where sometimes the drawing windows
                        wouldn't resize properly when dragged.</li>
                      <li>Added the ability to draw structures with their
                        backbone stretched out in a straight line.</li>
                      <li>Improved drawing of structures so large structures are
                        drawn faster, and move and zoom more efficiently.</li>
                      <li>Fixed a glitch in CircleCompare where sometimes the
                        probability annotation for the accepted structure was
                        being shown for all structures, not for each predicted
                        structure.</li>
                      <li>Fixed a glitch in CircleCompare where probability
                        annotation was not always consistent in pairs.</li>
                      <li>Added distinct flags to CircleCompare so the user can
                        annotation with either predicted or accepted structure
                        probabilities.</li>
                      <li>Added the ability for structure drawing programs to
                        read probability information from dot plot text files as
                        -log10(Probability).</li>
                      <li>Added the ability for ProbabilityPlot to read dot data
                        from a standard dot plot file.</li>

                        SHAPEslope and SHAPEintercept default values were
                        reversed. This reversal was only in the documentation.</li>

                    at all is given to a web server that takes sequence input.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in the Predict a Secondary Structure server
                    where the calculated partition function save file wasn't
                    being used for all calculations.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in the Multilign and TurboFold servers where

                <ol>
                  <li>Added webservers for all programs.</li>
                  <li>TurboKnot added to GUI as an option in TurboFold.</li>
                  <li>Breakage of DNA pseudoknots, as well as pseudoknot
                    breakage options, added to JAVA GUI.</li>
                  <li>Added 64-bit executables as downloads for Windows.</li>
                  <li>Revised Windows GUI to conform with Windows 7 standards.
                    This also fixes issues with drawing dot plots from text
                    files and issues with showing oligonucleotide self-structure
                    from the OligoWalk interface.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in the Windows GUI, where pressing the F1 key
                    resulted in a "Failed to Launch Help" window in Windows XP
                    and later.</li>
                  <li>Fixed command line bug in bifold interface where the
                    intramolecular flag did not always forbid intramolecular
                    pairs as it should have.</li>
                  <li>Fixed command line bug in text interfaces where whole
                    numbers specified with zeros after a decimal point were
                    sometimes rejected as non-numeric. Negative numbers were
                    also sometimes rejected as non-numeric.</li>
                  <li>Corrected the documentation for the Dynalign text
                    interface, where the default "DNA = false" should have been
                    written as "DNA = 0." Also, to set DNA folding, the user
                    should specify "DNA = 1."</li>
                  <li>Fixed a typo in miscloop.dat and dnamiscloop.dat tables in
                    data_tables directory. The file stated "miscloop asym," but
                    now states "multiloop asym." This value is the multibranch
                    loop asymmetry penalty that is used by efn2. This did not
                    affect structure prediction or energy calculations, and the
                    change was made to simply clarify what thermodynamic
                    parameter this is.</li>
                  <li>Corrected bug in JAVA GUI where the partition function
                    bimolecular module sometimes overwrote its second input
                    sequence file, rather than using the desired output name.</li>
                  <li>Corrected bug in JAVA GUI where file chooser extension
                    sanity checks sometimes failed.</li>
                  <li>Added an RNAstructure_java_utilities folder to facilitate
                    expansions in JAVA capabilities.</li>
                  <li>Re-implemented internal workings of the JAVA GUI to aid in
                    organization and comprehension.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in Dynalign, where conserved 3' dangling ends
                    on helices at exterior loops were not allowed.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in extrapolation of free energies to
                    temperatures other than 37 degrees C.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a dot plots bug where dots at the boundaries of
                    color ranges sometimes showed up as the wrong color or
                    disappeared.</li>
                  <li>Reorganized Makefiles to build more efficiently and
                    include explicit dependencies.</li>
                  <li>Standardized Postscript and SVG structure drawing so their
                    default is always clockwise orientation.</li>
                  <li>Added a redone JAVA drawing framework, which includes the
                    ability to create self-contained JAVA drawing programs for
                    structures and dot plots.</li>
                  <li>Simplified the controls in the JAVA drawing framework so
                    only the structure currently drawn can be exported to
                    Postscript.</li>
                  <li>Added items where necessary to the JAVA drawing framework
                    so structures and dot plots can be exported as both
                    Postscript and SVG.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug in JAVA drawing framework where the default
                    for structures wasn't clockwise orientation.</li>
                  <li>Removed "New Window" and "Arrange Icons" options, which
                    did nothing, from the menus of the Windows GUI.</li>
                  <li>Added ability to switch between structures and zoom in the
                    drawing framework using the command key (on Mac) as well as
                    the control key.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the description of MAP mode in the PARTS text
                    interface manual.</li>

                  <li>Added TurboFold to the package.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where drawing suboptimal structures did not
                    always work in the JAVA GUI for Mac and Linux.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where bimolecular partition functions were
                    missing some states (single dangling ends and no dangling
                    ends) at helix ends.</li>
                  <li>Added the ability to include SHAPE data when calculating
                    folding free energy changes with efn2 program.</li>
                  <li>Added the ability to apply folding restraints for the
                    formation of specified base pairs.</li>
                  <li>Corrected Windows and JAVA graphical interfaces for
                    OligoWalk to show the correct temperature of folding free
                    energy changes when a user adjusts the temperature of the
                    calculation. (Prior to this, free energies' changes were
                    always listed as being at 37 degrees C.)</li>
                  <li>Added the Overview help pages to the manual.</li>
                  <li>Corrected bug in JAVA GUI where the message bar at the
                    bottom of the screen didn't always update when a temperature
                    menu was clicked.</li>
                  <li>Corrected bug in JAVA GUI in OligoScreen where file names
                    were being refreshed incorrectly. Also switched oligomer
                    type default to DNA, rather than RNA.</li>
                  <li>Corrected bug in JAVA GUI of OligoWalk where
                    oligonucleotides were always RNA, even when DNA was
                    selected.</li>

                  <li>Added Multilign to the package.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue when breaking pseudoknots, but leaving the
                    maximum non-pseudoknotted pairs, where non-canonical pairs
                    in the input structure were mistakenly broken. This was also
                    an issue with the count of pseudoknotted pairs in the
                    CircleCompare program.</li>
                  <li>Added support for writing ct files for long sequences
                    (&gt;9,999 nucleotides).</li>
                  <li>Removed GAIL rule from dnamiscloop.dat and dnamiscloop.dh.</li>
                  <li>Made the internal loop asymmetry penalty a single constant
                    for DNA folding. This fixed an occassional bug with folding
                    by DNA rules.</li>
                  <li>In Windows GUI only, changed default value for the minimum
                    helix length in ProbKnot from 2 to 3, which is the preferred
                    value.</li>
                  <li>Added color-annotation for single-stranded nucleotides in
                    drawing programs.</li>
                  <li>Added the ability to use DNA parameters to the Dynalign

                  <li>Added the ability to change the folding temperature in the
                    Dynalign command line interface.</li>
                  <li>In the Windows GUI, set the default file choice to .ALI
                    when clicking the "Alignment File" button.</li>
                  <li>In Dynalign, revised the model for using alignment data to
                    limit the extent of calculation. This can lead to a
                    different set of suboptimal structures than previous
                    versions. This also fixes a traceback error encountered in
                    rare circumstances.</li>

                  <li>Changed the thermodynamic parameter for adding an
                    additional helix to a multibranch loop ("helix penalty" in
                    miscloop.dat). The value is now set to -0.6 kcal/mol, which
                    is the value determined by a linear regression fit to
                    experimental data. This value provides slighly higher
                    average accuracy for maximum expected accuracy structure
                    prediction (MaxExpect and ProbKnot programs). This change
                    means that predicted structures might be different than
                    those predicted by previous version of RNAstructure. Base
                    pair probabilities, however, should be highly similar to
                    predictions from previous versions of the program.</li>
                  <li>Added ProbKnot program to text interfaces and GUIs.</li>
                  <li>Added online help for text (command line interfaces).</li>
                  <li>Restructured downloads so that the text interface binaries
                    now also come with complete repository, including help and
                    examples.</li>
