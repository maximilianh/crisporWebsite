#Description of DNA Folding Alphabet

#Note that comments start with # and any number of comments are allowed.
#Note that # must start a line.

#The Bases field defines the characters allowed in the alphabet.
#The format requires each base type be on its own line.  
#An = separated by spaces from adjacent nucleotides allows the definition of equivalent bases.
#Note that for RNA folding, we allow the user to use U or T interchangeably.
#Note that I is the intermolecular linker for bimolecular folding.
#N and X are bases that cannot pair or stack.

Bases
X = N = x = n
A = a
C = c
G = g
U = u = T = t
I


#The Pairing field defines bases that can form canonical pairs.
#Note that each equivalent base should be represented only once.
#Note the space between bases that can pair.
#Note that there is no direction in a pair so that A U also means U A is a pair.

Pairing
A U
G C
G U

#The Single field defines bases that are not allowed to pair.
#This is maintained because RNAstructure has traditionally forced lowercase nucleotides unpaired.
#This field is required, although it may be empty.

Single
a
c
g
u
t

#The non-interacting field indicates nucleotides that neither pair nor stack.
#The parameter tables are filled to give this nucleotide a free energy change of zero for 
#stacking or mismatching.

Non-interacting
X

# #The linker field indicates a special "nucleotide" that indicates a break in the backbone.
# #This is an "intermolecular linker."  The parameter tables are filled to treat this as 
# #nucleotide that does not exist.  When appearing in a sequence, this should appear as 
# #three in a row.
