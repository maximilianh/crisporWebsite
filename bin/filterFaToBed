# filter fasta file and keep only sequences that end with pattern (if + strand)
# output as a bed file
# CAREFUL: input sequences have to be on a single line. This is different from normal fasta files.

# output is:
# nameFields = [seqId, strand, editDist, seq, alnCount, str(hitScore), isRep, flankSeq]

# arguments: guideSeqFaFname pamPat altPats altMinScore

# passHitCount is the maximum number of guide hits in the genome, as returned by the aligner, irrespective 
# of PAM presence. If a match has a sum of X0 and X1 beyond that, it is always shown in the output,
# because otherwise crispor.py cannot distinguish between non-matches and too-repetitive matches.

# 2nd input fasta is fasta read from stdin, with |-separated fields in the ID line:
# 0 = sequence ID
# 1 = chromosome
# 2 = start pos
# 3 = end pos
# 4 = strand
# 5 = BWA editDist
# 6 = BWA totalAlnCount  (=X0+X1)
# 7 = position of gap, -1 if not used. Usually not used.
# 8 = flanking nucleotides, beyond the PAM

# example input ( with field numbers above the ID line):
# 0     1      2       3       4 5  6    8  9
#>seq1|chrII|16108096|16108116|+|0|12345|-1|A
#TCGAAAGTGGTAAGAATTTAAGG

# example output:
# format: (seqId, strand, mismatchCount, seq, totalAlnCount, hitScore (or 0, if it was a pamPat match or passHitCount, flankSeq) 

# pamPat: 
# pam IUPAC pattern, all sequences that end with this pattern get through
# altPats: comma-sep list of patterns, all sequences with this pattern get only through
#          if they have >altMaxScore. The score is the hitScore as defined in Hsu et al 2013, 
#          see below
#          Can be "na" if not altPat search needed
# altMinScore: hits ending with one of altPats have to exceed this threshold, otherwise 
#          they are skipped
